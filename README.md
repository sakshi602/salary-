I took this project from the study case assignment Mini Course Data Analytics Revou in the batch from July 25 to August 5, 2022

This Salary Dataset Project uses various tools, namely :
1. **Python with Google Colab** to *view data and perform data cleaning* before data is used,
2. **Google BigQuery** to *create queries from datasets* so that they are ready for further visualization, and
3. **GDS or Google Data Studio** to *perform Data Visualization*.

The following is a description of the file used :
1. The original dataset is on **salary_dataset.csv** file.
2. Cleaning data using python as in the **datacleaning_salary.py** file.
3. Same as using python regarding the data exploration steps, only the file extension is different, where the file **datacleaning_salary.ipynb** can be used for Jupyter Notebook.
4. The dataset that has been done Data Cleaning is in the **salary-dataset.csv** file.
5. SQL query file that will be used for data visualization is contained in the **query.sql** file.
6. The file with the Power Point extension (**ASSIGNMENT4.pptx**) contains the steps and the results of the work that has been done.
7. The file with the Portable Document Format (PDF) extension (**ASSIGNMENT4.pdf**) contains the steps and the results of the work same as the PPT file, that has been done.

The steps for Data Cleaning are as follows :
1. Change data type 
2. Remove duplicated data : from 607 data to 562 data, where there are 45 duplicate data, which is 7.41% of the total data.
3. Remove empty data 
4. Remove outliers : Delete data that has a value that exceeds the upper and lower limits (data outliers) in the â€˜salary_in_usd' column, so that the total data becomes 552.
5. Remove unnecessary data
